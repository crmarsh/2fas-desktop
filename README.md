2FAS Desktop
===

This is a quick helper GUI to use the backup data from [2FAS](https://2fas.com/) from the desktop. It creates a system tray icon, a menu item from each entry, clicking on them copies the code to the clipboard.

At the moment you need to run it from the command line to enter the password needed to load your file (from a hard coded location). Maybe I'll add a file dialog or something at some point.
